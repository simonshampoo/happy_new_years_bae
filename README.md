# Happy New Years Bae 😘

a Python script I quickly whipped up to text my girlfriends "happy new years bae 😘" exactly when the clock hit 12:00 A.M

# Usage

this script has not been extensively tested, and probably will never be. you need MacOS and an iMessage account with the iMessage application open as there isn't (afaik) a direct API for iMessage.

1. open terminal and paste ```git clone https://github.com/simonshampoo/happy_new_years_bae.git```
2. ```cd happy_new_years_bae```
3. populate the `recipients` list with a bunch of numbers in the specified format `'+1XXXYYYZZZZ'`
4. `python3 main.py`
